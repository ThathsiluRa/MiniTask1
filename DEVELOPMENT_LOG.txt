================================================================================
                                WEEK 1
================================================================================

DAY 1-2: PROJECT SETUP AND PLANNING
===================================

Progress:
- Initialized React project using Vite
- Set up Tailwind CSS for styling
- Configured project structure and dependencies
- Created basic component architecture

Challenges Faced:
- Deciding between Create React App vs Vite (chose Vite for better performance)
- Setting up Tailwind CSS with PostCSS configuration
- Understanding the project scope and requirements

Solutions:
- Researched modern React build tools and chose Vite for faster development
- Followed Tailwind CSS official documentation for proper setup
- Created detailed project plan with component hierarchy

Key Learnings:
- Vite provides significantly faster development server startup
- Tailwind CSS utility-first approach speeds up styling
- Proper project structure is crucial for maintainability

Code Snippet - Project Structure:
```
src/
├── components/
│   ├── Auth.jsx
│   ├── TaskBoard.jsx
│   ├── TaskColumn.jsx
│   └── TaskCard.jsx
├── contexts/
│   └── AuthContext.jsx
├── lib/
│   └── supabase.js
├── App.jsx
├── main.jsx
└── index.css
```

DAY 3-4: SUPABASE INTEGRATION AND AUTHENTICATION
===============================================

Progress:
- Set up Supabase project and database
- Implemented user authentication (sign up/sign in)
- Created authentication context for state management
- Designed login and signup forms

Challenges Faced:
- Understanding Supabase authentication flow
- Managing authentication state across components
- Setting up proper database schema with RLS

Solutions:
- Studied Supabase documentation and examples
- Implemented AuthContext for centralized auth state
- Created comprehensive database schema with proper security

Key Learnings:
- Supabase provides excellent authentication out of the box
- Row Level Security (RLS) is essential for data protection
- Context API is perfect for sharing auth state across components

Database Schema:
```sql
CREATE TABLE tasks (
  id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  status TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'todo',
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Enable Row Level Security
ALTER TABLE tasks ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create policy for user data isolation
CREATE POLICY "Users can only access their own tasks" ON tasks
  FOR ALL USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

DAY 5-7: CORE FUNCTIONALITY DEVELOPMENT
=======================================

Progress:
- Implemented task creation, editing, and deletion
- Created Kanban board with three columns (To Do, In Progress, Done)
- Added basic drag and drop functionality
- Implemented real-time updates using Supabase subscriptions

Challenges Faced:
- Implementing drag and drop with react-beautiful-dnd
- Managing task state across multiple columns
- Handling real-time updates without conflicts
- PostCSS errors with Tailwind utilities

Solutions:
- Switched to @hello-pangea/dnd for better React 18 compatibility
- Used Supabase real-time subscriptions for live updates
- Implemented proper state management with React hooks
- Fixed PostCSS issues by using Tailwind utilities directly in JSX

Key Learnings:
- @hello-pangea/dnd is the maintained fork of react-beautiful-dnd
- Real-time subscriptions require careful state management
- Tailwind utilities should be used in JSX, not in @apply directives

Code Snippet - Task Management:
```jsx
// Task creation
const createTask = async (title, description, status) => {
  const { data, error } = await supabase
    .from('tasks')
    .insert([
      { title, description, status, user_id: user.id }
    ]);
  
  if (error) console.error('Error creating task:', error);
  return data;
};

// Real-time subscription
useEffect(() => {
  const subscription = supabase
    .channel('tasks')
    .on('postgres_changes', 
      { event: '*', schema: 'public', table: 'tasks' },
      (payload) => {
        // Handle real-time updates
        updateTasks(payload);
      }
    )
    .subscribe();

  return () => subscription.unsubscribe();
}, []);
```

Challenges Faced:
- Achieving glass morphism effect with proper browser support
- Making the design responsive across all devices
- Implementing smooth animations without performance issues
- Color scheme selection and consistency

Solutions:
- Used backdrop-filter CSS property with fallbacks
- Implemented mobile-first responsive design
- Used CSS transitions for smooth animations
- Created consistent color palette with proper contrast

Key Learnings:
- Glass morphism requires careful consideration of browser support
- Mobile-first approach makes responsive design easier

- Color accessibility is crucial for good UX

Design Features Implemented:
- Glass morphism cards with backdrop blur
- Gradient backgrounds (blue to purple)

- Responsive breakpoints for all screen sizes

Code Snippet - Glass Morphism Styling:
```css
.task-card {
  background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1);
  backdrop-filter: blur(10px);
  border: 1px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2);
  border-radius: 12px;
  box-shadow: 0 8px 32px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
  transition: all 0.3s ease;
}

.task-card:hover {
  transform: translateY(-2px);
  box-shadow: 0 12px 40px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);
